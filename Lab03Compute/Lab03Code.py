# TASK Q1 -- Answer questions regarding your implementation
#
# Consider the following game between an adversary A and honest users H1 and H2: 
# 1) H1 picks 3 plaintext integers Pa, Pb, Pc arbitrarily, and encrypts them to the public
#    key of H2 using the scheme you defined in TASK 1.
# 2) H1 provides the ciphertexts Ca, Cb and Cc to H2 who flips a fair coin b.
#    In case b=0 then H2 homomorphically computes C as the encryption of Pa plus Pb.
#    In case b=1 then H2 homomorphically computes C as the encryption of Pb plus Pc.
# 3) H2 provides the adversary A, with Ca, Cb, Cc and C.
#
# What is the advantage of the adversary in guessing b given your implementation of 
# Homomorphic addition? What are the security implications of this?

""" Your Answer here """

""" If the adversary has the ability to perform homomorphic operations, then they no-doubt have the advantage of being able to guess b.
We are told that:
b:0 -> C = Ca + Cb
b:1 -> C = Cb + Cc

Therefore, if the adversary can calculate C - Cb, then they will get a result of either Ca or Cc depending on the value of b. Comparing the result
with the values of Ca and Cc supplied by H2 will inform the adversary of the value of b.

The security implication of this is that the adversery can easily undo homomophic operations performed given that they know the equations used
and are given values used to calculate them.

# TASK Q2 -- Answer questions regarding your implementation
#
# Given your implementation of the private poll in TASK 5, how
# would a malicious user implement encode_vote to (a) distrupt the
# poll so that it yields no result, or (b) manipulate the poll so 
# that it yields an arbitrary result. Can those malicious actions 
# be detected given your implementation?

""" Your Answer here """
"""
A: To disrupt the poll so that it yieilds no result, the malicious user can simply modify the number of votes used in encode_votes to a value that would yield no result.
For example, the user could set the number of votes to zero, giving no result.
B: Similarly to manipulate the poll to give an arbilary result the user could modify the number of votes to give the result they want. 

These actions would not be detected in my implementation as encode_vote does not attempt to verify the input of the number of votes, thus allowing a 
malicious user to modify them.
